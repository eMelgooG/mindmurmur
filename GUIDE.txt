Wifi setup for Muse headset

1. Open the wifi menu at the bottom-right next to the clock. Click "Mobile Hotspot" so it turns blue. The laptop is now acting as a wifi network.
2. Right-click the blue icon and click "Settings".
3. Take the Android phone and connect it to the wifi network using the network name and password shown.
4. Back on the laptop, you will see a left sidebar in the Settings window. Under Network & Internet, click on "Status".
5. Click "View your network properties".
6. On the phone, start Muse Monitor and go to its settings.
7. In Muse Monitor settings, confirm that the "OSC Stream Port" is set to 7000.
8. In Muse Monitor settings, confirm that the "OSC Stream Target IP" is one of the IPv4 addresses that is "Operational", from step 5.
9. In Muse Monitor, go back and in the bottom bar, tap the icon that looks like 2 circles (just to the left of the red recor button).
A popup will appear above the bottom bar saying "Streaming to x.x.x.x:7000"
10. To test:
  a. Go to the mindmurmur files
  b. Run "run_osc.bat"
  c. Power the headset on
  d. Connect the to Muse Monitor and get it positioned so the horseshoe disappears
  e. On the laptop, confirm that non-zero values appear in the output
11. When done testing, close the window that popped up from "run_osc.bat".

If you do not see the nonzero EEG values coming through, it means you have the wrong IPv4 address in Muse Monitor, or Muse Monitor streaming is not enabled.
You should try one of the other IPv4 addresses that is "Operational", from step 5.

If Muse Monitor will not connect to the Muse headset, kill it and try again (bottom left button on the phone).

Starting everything

1. Double-click "run_all.bat", or the shortcut on the desktop.
